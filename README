# dtas - duct tape audio suite for *nix

Free Software command-line tools for audio playback, mastering, and
whatever else related to audio.  dtas follows the worse-is-better
philosophy and acts as duct tape to combine existing command-line tools
for flexibility and ease-of-development.  dtas is currently implemented
in Ruby (and some embedded shell), but may use other languages in the
future.

Primary executables available are:

* dtas-player - gapless music player (or pipeline/process manager :P)
* dtas-cueedit - embedded cuesheet editor (FLAC-only for now)
* dtas-splitfx - split audio and apply effects to all tracks

The centerpiece is dtas-player, a gapless music player designed to aid
in writing scripts for sox/ecasound use.  Unlike monolithic music
players, dtas-player is close to a *nix shell in functionality, allowing
for the execution of arbitrary commands as sources, filters, and sinks
for audio.  dtas-player supports:

* any DSP effects offered by SoX, ecasound, LADSPA, LV2, etc..
* multiple outputs for playback (including dumping audio to
  files or piping to arbitrary commands)
* ReplayGain (including fallback gain and peak normalization)

dtas-player is a *nix pipeline and process manager.  It may be used
spawn and pipe to abitrary Unix commands, not just audio-related
commands.  It can interactively restart/replace the source (audio
decoder) component of a pipeline while keeping the sink (playback
endpoint) running.

Users of dtas-player will also be interested in the following scripts:

* dtas-ctl - "raw" command-line scripting interface for dtas-player
* dtas-enq - enqueue files/commands for dtas-player
* dtas-msinkctl - enable/disable multiple sinks with one command
* dtas-console - rudimentary curses interface for dtas-player
* dtas-sinkedit - edit sinks (playback targets) for dtas-player
* dtas-sourceedit - edit source (decoder process parameters) for dtas-player
* dtas-xdelay - alternative sink for dtas-player
* dtas-tl - command-line helpers for tracklist functionality in dtas-player

All scripts have some documentation in the Documentation/ directory or
manpages distributed with the gem.  Documentation is also available on
https://80x24.org/dtas/$COMMAND.txt in plain-text form.

dtas exposes no public APIs outside of command-line and YAML text.  dtas is
aimed at users familiar with the *nix command-line and editing text files.
Familiarity with the Ruby programming language is absolutely NOT required.

Coming:

* mpd (Music Player Daemon) bridge for partial dtas-player control
* MPRIS/MPRIS 2.0 bridge for partial dtas-player control
* whatever command-line tools come to mind...
* better error handling, many bugfixes, etc...
* better documentation
