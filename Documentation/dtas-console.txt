# NAME

dtas-console - rudimentary curses console client for dtas-player

# SYNOPSIS

dtas-console

# DESCRIPTION

dtas-console displays the elapsed decoder time of the track, which can be
used as an approximation of the current playback time of a track.

It cannot display an accurate playback time due to variable buffering
in the sinks and pipes.

See dtas-player_protocol(7) for a detailed description of the protocol.

# KEYBOARD CONTROL

Key bindings are inspired partially by mplayer(1)
