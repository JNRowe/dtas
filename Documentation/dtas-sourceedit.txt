# NAME

dtas-sourceedit - edit parameters of a source decoder

# SYNOPSYS

dtas-sourceedit {sox | av | ff}

# DESCRIPTION

dtas-sourceedit spawns an editor to allow editing of a source as a YAML file.
See dtas-player_protocol(7) for details on SOURCEARGS.  If standard input is
a pipe or file, it is parsed as YAML and fed to the dtas-player(1) instance
non-interactively.  This is useful for loading various profiles from the
filesystem.

On Linux machines with the sleepy_penguin RubyGem installed, inotify(7)
is used to monitor the file for changes while the text exitor is running.
Each time a user finishes saving a file, changes are committed immediately.
This behavior may be disabled by using the -N or --no-watch command-line
switch.

# OPTIONS

-N, \--no-watch
:   Disable inotify(7) support on Linux systems

-n, \--dry-run
:   Only print commands which would be sent to dtas-player

-V, \--verbose
:   Print out commands as they are sent to dtas-player

# EXAMPLES

Invoking dtas-sourceedit will spawn your favorite text editor on "sox":

	$ dtas-sourceedit sox

To load an existing YAML profile for sox.  saved.yml could be the output
of a previous "dtas-ctl source cat sox" invocation:

	$ dtas-sourceedit sox < saved.yml

To change the way dtas-player calls avconv (part of libav):

	$ dtas-sourceedit av

To change the way dtas-player calls ffmpeg (lightly-tested):

	$ dtas-sourceedit ff

# ENVIRONMENT

VISUAL / EDITOR - your favorite *nix text editor, defaults to 'vi' if unset.

DTAS_PLAYER_SOCK - the path to the dtas-player control socket.
This defaults to ~/.dtas/player.sock
