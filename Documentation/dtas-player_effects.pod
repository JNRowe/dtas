L<dtas-player(1)> effects overview

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Effects in dtas-player may be applied either at the source or the sink.
They are applied in the order described.

=over

=item 1. source effects

Source effects are effects which should be applied per-source and do not
rely on inter-track information.

Examples include:

=over

=item ReplayGain (simple gain changes)

=item anything which does not change the length of the audio:

gain, stereo, highpass, lowpass, loudness, bass, treble, equalizer, ...

=back

Modifying source effects should introduce no extra gaps in playback.
Effects which modify the length of the audio is not recommended here,
as seek functionality will be impaired.

=item 2. sink effects

Sink effects are any effects which:

=over

=item 1) should only be applied to a specific sink

=item 2) effects which require inter-track information

(multiband delays/compressors/expanders)

=item 3) alter the length of the audio

=back

In a multi-zone audio system (where each zone has its own sink), sink
effects may also customize the sound of a certain zone while not
affecting others.

Examples include:

=over

=item equalizer effects (highpass/bass/treble/equalizer)

=item loudness

=item delaying a certain channel or frequency range for time-alignment

=item compressors/limiters

=item reverb

=item gain

=item remix (for stereo image adjustments)

=back

Additionally, effects which are necessary due to the limitation of the
playback hardware are applied at the sink:

=over

=item rate

=item dither

=item remix (static channel mappings)

=back
