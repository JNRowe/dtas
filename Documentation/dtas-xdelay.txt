# NAME

dtas-xdelay - play audio with a crossover delay

# SYNOPSYS

dtas-xdelay [OPTIONS] INPUT1 INPUT2 DELAY

# DESCRIPTION

dtas-xdelay will delay an audio band by a given delay (in seconds or
fractions thereof).  This can be useful for tuning a sub/sat speaker
system.  It is intended for use a dtas-player sink command as displayed
in the synopsis.

The INPUT arguments (/dev/fd/lo and /dev/fd/hi) are automatically
changed by dtas-player to match the given file descriptors of the pipes.

Both descriptors receive the same audio data, but will be split using a
Linkwitz-Riley crossover.  The high-band (second argument) will be
delayed by default.

# EXAMPLE

To set this via dtas-player to delay the high frequencies by 20ms.

	dtas-ctl sink ed SINKNAME \
	   command='dtas-xdelay /dev/fd/lo /dev/fd/hi 0.020'

# OPTIONS

-x, \--crossover-frequency FREQUENCY
:   Frequency at which to set the crossover.  This defaults to 80 (Hz).

-l, \--lowpass-delay
:   Delay the lowpass frequency instead of the highpass one.

# ENVIRONMENT

SOXFMT - this environment is automatically set if used as a dtas-player
sink

DTAS_PLAYER_SOCK - the path to the dtas-player control socket.
This defaults to ~/.dtas/player.sock
