# NAME

dtas-player_sink_examples - sink examples for dtas-player

# SYNOPSIS

dtas-ctl sink ed SINKNAME command='...'
dtas-sinkedit SINKNAME

# EXAMPLES

## Streaming Ogg-Vorbis to Icecast

To use oggfwd(1) and Icecast, the following sink works.
Warning: the following example will likely expose your Icecast source
password to any local users on the system.

    # set HOST/PORT/PASS via env or directly in the command
    ---
    name: oggfwd
    command: sox $SOXFMT - -t ogg - | oggfwd $HOST $PORT $PASS /dtas.ogg

## Stream to a remote host via ssh

Alternatively, if you have play(1) installed on any remote host and
a slow connection using Ogg-Vorbis:

    # Long lines in YAML can be broken up and the subsequent lines
    # indented with by spaces
    ---
    name: ssh-remote
    command: sox $SOXFMT - -t ogg - |
      ssh $HOST env AUDIODEV=... play -q -t ogg -

    # Note the use of env(1), as the "env" parameter for the sink may not be
    # passed via ssh to the remote $HOST depending on the ssh_config(5)
    # configuration.

If you have a fast connection, there is no need to encode using
Ogg-Vorbis.  Alternatively, you may also use "flac" instead of "ogg" in
the above Ogg-Vorbis example.

    ---
    name: ssh-remote
    command: ssh $HOST env AUDIODEV=... play -q $SOXFMT -

## Dump audio to a file during playback

To configure a dumper sink (in addition to the "default" sink).  Note
the use of $SOXFMT, this will be automatically expanded to match the
internal format of the player.  The internal format of the player is
described in dtas-player_protocol(7).

    $ dtas-ctl sink ed dumper command='sox $SOXFMT - /tmp/dump.sox'

Non-"default" sinks are not active by default, but may be made active.

    $ dtas-ctl sink ed dumper active=true

Changing it again to "active=false" will deactivate the sink.

## Apply a short delay to low frequencies to improve time-alignment

See dtas-xdelay(1).
