# NAME

dtas-tl - tracklist manipulation for dtas-player (development)

# SYNOPSYS

dtas-tl [COMMANDS]

# DESCRIPTION

dtas-tl provides utility functions for manipulating the tracklist of the
dtas-player (not the queue, the tracklist is separate from the queue).
It is mainly intended as a development tool and will likely go away in
the future or have its functionality merged into another tool (or MPRIS
client).

# COMMANDS

* addhead - add multiple tracks to the beginning of the tracklist
* addtail - add multiple tracks to the end of the tracklist
* current - display the current track, "NONE" if not playing
* current-id - display the TRACKID of the current track
  "NONE" if not playing
* cat - display a newline-delimited list of TRACK_ID=PATH output
  Note: this is shell-escaped, multibyte characters may not show up properly.
* clear - remove all tracks from the tracklist
* edit - spawn an editor to allow editing the tracklist as a text file
  See EDITING for more information.
* goto TRACKID [POS] - play TRACKID immediately, optionally seek to POS
TRACKID may be looked up via cat, and POS should be a timestamp in
HH:MM:SS.FRAC format.
* reto REGEXP [POS] - play first track with path matching REGEXP immediately,
optionally seek to POS.  POS should be a timestamp in HH:MM:SS.FRAC format.
* next - play the next track in the tracklist
* prev - play the previous track in the tracklist
* repeat 1 - repeat the current track
* repeat false - disable repeat
* repeat true - enable repeat of the whole tracklist

See dtas-player_protocol(7) for a detailed description of the protocol.

# EXAMPLES

display the current tracklist

        $ dtas-tl cat

to add an an entire directory of FLAC files

        $ dtas-tl addtail /path/to/directory/*.flac

to skip forward in the tracklist

        $ dtas-tl next

to skip backwards in the tracklist

        $ dtas-tl prev

# EDITING

It is possible to edit the player tracklist from your favorite text
editor.  Existing lines denoting tracks may be rearranged, deleted,
copied or entirely new lines with path names (without a trailing "
=TRACK_ID") may be added.

Changes to the tracklist are sent to the player when the user exits the
editor.  This functionality only works when there is one user editing
the tracklist at a time, and when no files in the tracklist contain rare
newline characters.

# ENVIRONMENT

VISUAL / EDITOR - your favorite *nix text editor, defaults to 'vi' if unset.

DTAS_PLAYER_SOCK - the path to the dtas-player control socket.
This defaults to ~/.dtas/player.sock
