# NAME

dtas-archive - paranoid audio file copy

# SYNOPSYS

dtas-archive [OPTIONS] SOURCE DESTINATION

# DESCRIPTION

dtas-archive is intended for archiving audio data to/from laptops,
marginal USB ports, and computers without ECC memory, attempting
to read data multiple times in an attempt to detect memory or
bus corruption.  dtas-archive may only be effective on machines
running the Linux kernel where posix_fadvise(2) can be used to
drop caches for a particular file after fsync(2).

dtas-archive spawns sox(1) to archive audio data (likely uncompressed
WAVE) to FLAC and verifies the result using sndfile-cmp(1), a tool
implemented by different than sox and less likely to share the same bugs
(if any) as sox.

# OPTIONS

-j, \--jobs [JOBS]
:    Number of jobs to run in parallel.  Incrementing this may hurt
     performance on slow storage devices.  Default: 1

-n, \--dry-run
:    Print, but do not run the commands to be executed

-s, \--quiet, \--silent
:    Silent operation, commands are not printed as executed

-S, \--stats
:    Run and save the text output of the sox "stats" effect as
     $DESTINATION_FILE_WITHOUT_SUFFIX.stats next to the output file

-k, \--keep-going
:    Continue after error

-r, \--repeat [COUNT]
:    Number of times to repeat the sndfile-cmp(1) check.  Default: 1
