# NAME

dtas-sinkedit - edit the command and environment of a sink

# SYNOPSYS

dtas-sinkedit SINKNAME

# DESCRIPTION

dtas-sinkedit spawns an editor to allow editing of a sink as a YAML file.
See dtas-player_protocol(7) for details on SINKARGS.

On Linux machines with the sleepy_penguin RubyGem installed, inotify(7)
is used to monitor the file for changes while the text exitor is running.
Each time a user finishes saving a file, changes are committed immediately.
This behavior may be disabled by using the -N or --no-watch command-line
switch.

# OPTIONS
-N, \--no-watch
:   Disable inotify(7) support on Linux systems

-n, \--dry-run
:   Only print commands which would be sent to dtas-player

-V, \--verbose
:   Print out commands as they are sent to dtas-player

# EXAMPLES

To get a list of existing sink names

	$ dtas-ctl ls

Invoking dtas-sinkedit will spawn your favorite text editor on a
given SINKNAME:

	$ dtas-sinkedit SINKNAME

If SINKNAME was not listed, it will be created (in an inactive state).
Successfully exiting your text editor will send the changes to the
running dtas-player.

# ENVIRONMENT

VISUAL / EDITOR - your favorite *nix text editor, defaults to 'vi' if unset.

DTAS_PLAYER_SOCK - the path to the dtas-player control socket.
This defaults to ~/.dtas/player.sock
