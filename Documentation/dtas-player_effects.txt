Effects in dtas-player may be applied either at the source or the sink.
They are applied in the order described.

1. source effects

  Source effects are effects which should be applied per-source and do not
  rely on inter-track information.

  Examples include:
  - ReplayGain (simple vol/gain changes)
  - anything which does not change the length of the audio:
    vol, stereo, highpass, lowpass, loudness, bass, treble, equalizer, ...

  Modifying source effects should introduce no extra gaps in playback.
  Effects which modify the length of the audio is not recommended here,
  as seek functionality will be impaired.

2. sink effects

  Sink effects are any effects which:

  1) should only be applied to a specific sink
  2) effects which require inter-track information
     (multiband delays/compressors/expanders)
  3) alter the length of the audio

  In a multi-zone audio system (where each zone has its own sink), sink
  effects may also customize the sound of a certain zone while not
  affecting others.

  Examples include:
  - equalizer effects (highpass/bass/treble/equalizer)
  - loudness
  - delaying a certain channel or frequency range for time-alignment
  - compressors/limiters
  - reverb
  - vol
  - remix (for stereo image adjustments)

  Additionally, effects which are necessary due to the limitation of the
  playback hardware are applied at the sink:

  - rate
  - dither
  - remix (static channel mappings)
