dtas-player troubleshooting guide
---------------------------------

dtas-player is heavily dependent on external commands such as sox(1)/play(1)
and ecasound(1).

* problem: audio playback does not start

  Since dtas-player just runs the play(1) command, the first step is to
  ensure play(1) works without dtas-player.

  Consult SoX documentation and mailing lists for getting play(1) to work,
  first.
