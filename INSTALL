Uncommon for audio software, dtas is currently implemented in Ruby.

The latest stable release or development snapshot of Ruby is recommended.
However, Ruby 1.9.3 and later works, but older versions of Ruby do not.

SoX is a dependency of dtas-player.  While not _strictly_ required,
dtas-player uses SoX by default and you will need it unless you've
reconfigured dtas-player to use something else.

mp3gain is required if you want to use ReplayGain with MP3s
(it is no longer in new versions of Debian)

If you only intend to use dtas-cueedit, you will need metaflac(1) from
the FLAC package.

Debian 10+ users can install dependencies easily:

    sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all flac ruby-dev ruby-charlock-holmes

For future upgrades of dtas

    sudo gem update dtas

# installing the dtas RubyGem on non-GNU/Linux or old GNU/Linux systems

    sudo gem install dtas

# installing dtas via tarball and setup.rb

Grab the latest tarball from our HTTPS site:

    https://80x24.org/dtas/2021/dtas-0.18.1.tar.gz

    $ tar zxvf dtas-0.18.1.tar.gz
    $ cd dtas-0.18.1
    $ sudo ruby setup.rb

GNU/Linux users may optionally install the "sleepy_penguin" RubyGem
for a tiny speed improvement over the default "fiddle" RubyGem.
