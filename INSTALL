Uncommon for audio software, dtas is implemented in Ruby.

The latest stable release of Ruby is recommended, currently 2.0.0-p247.
We are currently NOT compatible with Ruby 1.9.3, but we may support it
if there is demand.

SoX is a dependency of dtas.  While not _strictly_ required, the
dtas-player uses SoX by default and you will need it unless you've
reconfigured dtas to use something else.

mp3gain is required if you use ReplayGain with MP3s, and metaflac is
required for dtas-cueedit (and possibly future scripts).

Debian users can install sox, mp3gain, and flac dependencies easily:

  apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all mp3gain flac

= installing dtas RubyGem on GNU/Linux (Linux kernel 2.6.32+)

  Be sure to have Ruby development headers and a working C compiler.
  This will pull in the io_splice and sleepy_penguin RubyGems for minor
  speedups.  If you cannot be bothered to have a development
  environment, just use "gem install dtas"

  gem install dtas-linux

= installing dtas RubyGem on non-GNU/Linux or old GNU/Linux systems

  gem install dtas
