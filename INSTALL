Uncommon for audio software, dtas is implemented in Ruby.

The latest stable release or development snapshot of Ruby is recommended.
However, Ruby 1.9.3 and later works, but older versions of Ruby do not.

SoX is a dependency of dtas-player.  While not _strictly_ required,
dtas-player uses SoX by default and you will need it unless you've
reconfigured dtas-player to use something else.

mp3gain is required if you want to use ReplayGain with MP3s

If you only intend to use dtas-cueedit, you will need metaflac(1) from
the FLAC package.

Debian 7+ users can install dependencies easily:

    sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all mp3gain flac ruby-dev

# installing dtas RubyGem on GNU/Linux (Linux kernel 2.6.32+)

Be sure to have Ruby development headers and a working C compiler.
This will pull in the io_splice and sleepy_penguin RubyGems for minor
speedups.  If you cannot be bothered to have a development
environment, just use "gem install dtas".

    sudo gem install dtas-linux

This should pull in the "io_splice" and "sleepy_penguin" RubyGems

For future upgrades of dtas (upgrades to dtas-linux will be infrequent)

    sudo gem update dtas

# installing the dtas RubyGem on non-GNU/Linux or old GNU/Linux systems

    sudo gem install dtas

# installing dtas via tarball and setup.rb

Grab the latest tarball from our HTTP site:

    http://dtas.80x24.org/2016/dtas-0.14.2.tar.gz

    $ tar zxvf dtas-0.14.2.tar.gz
    $ cd dtas-0.14.2
    $ sudo ruby setup.rb

GNU/Linux users may optionally install "io_splice" and
"sleepy_penguin" packages:

    * io_splice - http://bogomips.org/ruby_io_splice/
    * sleepy_penguin - http://bogomips.org/sleepy_penguin/
