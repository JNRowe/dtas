Uncommon for audio software, dtas is implemented in Ruby.

The latest stable release of Ruby is recommended, currently 2.0.0-p247.
However, Ruby 1.9.3 should work, too.  Older versions of Ruby are not
recommended.

SoX is a dependency of dtas-player.  While not _strictly_ required, the
dtas-player uses SoX by default and you will need it unless you've
reconfigured dtas-player to use something else.

mp3gain is required if you use ReplayGain with MP3s

If you only intend to use dtas-cueedit, you will need metaflac(1) from
the FLAC package.

Debian users can install sox, mp3gain, and flac dependencies easily:

  apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all mp3gain flac

= installing dtas RubyGem on GNU/Linux (Linux kernel 2.6.32+)

  Be sure to have Ruby development headers and a working C compiler.
  This will pull in the io_splice and sleepy_penguin RubyGems for minor
  speedups.  If you cannot be bothered to have a development
  environment, just use "gem install dtas"

    gem install dtas-linux

  This should pull in the "io_splice" and "sleepy_penguin" RubyGems

  For future upgrades of dtas (upgrades to dtas-linux will be infrequent)

    gem update dtas

= installing the dtas RubyGem on non-GNU/Linux or old GNU/Linux systems

  gem install dtas

= installing dtas via tarball and setup.rb

  Grab the latest tarball from our HTTP site:

  http://dtas.80x24.org/2013/dtas-0.0.0.tar.gz

  $ tar zxvf dtas-0.0.0.tar.gz
  $ cd dtas-0.0.0
  $ ruby setup.rb

  GNU/Linux users may optionally install "io_splice" and
  "sleepy_penguin" packages:

  io_splice - http://bogomips.org/ruby_io_splice/
  sleepy_penguin - http://bogomips.org/sleepy_penguin/
